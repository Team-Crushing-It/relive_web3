Also, for those who are interested in our backend implmentation where we actually connect to IPFS, feel free to visit that here 
https://github.com/Team-Crushing-It/relive_datalayer
 
in addtion, to the data layer which allows us to upload to ipfs, we've found a solution to make our node like a public gateway in a way we can send HTTP requests to the gateway and we did it using a tool called pktriot to make the local host 5001 port global with a custom domain.
